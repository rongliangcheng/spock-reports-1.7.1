### An incredibly long feature description that unfortunately will popup in some cases where business
	analysts write these too detailed overviews of what the test should be all about when what they really
	should do is to let the details go in the body of the test using the Gherkin language which underlies BDD
	and is proven to make it easier for all involved to understand what the test is doing, what the inputs are
	and what the expected outcomes are in such a way that the best possible common understanding is reached
